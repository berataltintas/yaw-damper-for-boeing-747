This repository contains a MATLAB implementation of a Yaw Damper system for the Boeing 747 aircraft. I used MATLAB tutorial for this project. The project focuses on modeling and analyzing the lateral-directional dynamics of the aircraft, including:

Dutch roll mode damping

Spiral mode mitigation

Use of washout filters to filter slow-varying signals such as in Spiral Mode

The code includes:

State-space model of the a Boeing 747 lateral dynamics

Feedback control implementation for yaw damping

Impulse and step response simulations

Root locus and Bode plot analyses for system stability and performance
